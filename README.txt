Proctor is a tool for running unit tests.  It enhances the standard
unittest module to provide the ability to find all tests in a set of
code, categorize them via tagging, and run some or all of them.  Test
output may be generated in a variety of formats to support parsing by
another tool or simple, nicely formatted, reports for human review.

For help with the command line interface, run ``proctorbatch --help``.
